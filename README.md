## XBuilders (w/ Processing 4.0)
A Voxel game written in java and using Processing 4.0

Textures taken mostly from Pixel Perfection:
* https://github.com/Athemis/PixelPerfectionCE/tree/master
* https://github.com/Wallbraker/PixelPerfection?tab=readme-ov-file

## Current Features
This version of XBuilders is a lot more feature heavy than XBuilders w/ LWJGL. I hope to eventually port all of these features over to the LWJGL version at some point:

* Animals, and Vehicles
  * Horses, Mules, Cats, Foxes, Rabbit, Fish, Sea Turtle
* We have minecarts and a track system
* Create banners to hang up in your world
* Fences, stairs, slabs and even carpet can be used
* Block tools, allowing for faster block building
  * Block boundary
  * Block repaint
  * Copy/Paste
  * Sphere creation/deletion
* Custom vehicles can be build, in a driving, underwater or flying configuration configuration
  * Build a helecopter with the helecopter blade
  * Make a fast flying jet
  * Build a boat or underwater submarine
  * Make an off roader or sports car

## Contributing
All contributions welcome! If you want to contribute to XBuilders, I would appreciate the most help with a version of the game that is better suited for preformance, using LWJGL instead of Processing:
